1.What did you hope to learn but did not?
--I hoped to learn Hapi.js in class, but we instead talk about Express.

2.What did you really enjoy learning about?
--I really enjoy learning about the React and Redux part of the class, it teach me a frame work to build web app.

3.What worked well in the course? and how?
--Step by step learning is the most important thing in this class. We finish inclass exercise under the help of Scott first then finishing homework is much easier.

4.What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved?
--The End to end test part doesn't work well in this part, I think. Maybe because my computer broke at that period.

5.What could I have done to help you more, presentation of material, design of in class exercises, goals of projects â€“ and be specific please!
Some of the inclass exercises were difficult and required a lot of time. It would have been better if a little more help were offered through slides.

6.Anything else you like to say?
Thank you for this course.
